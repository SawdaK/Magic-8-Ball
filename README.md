**Description:**  
The Magic 8 Ball program is a fun and interactive application that emulates the famous fortune-telling toy. It engages the user in a simple but engaging conversation by allowing them to ask any question and receiving random answers from the mystical "8 Ball." Below is an overview of how the program works:  

**•	Initialization:** When the program starts, it welcomes the user with a prompt, "Ask me anything," inviting the user to pose a question to the Magic 8 Ball.  
**•	User Input:** The program waits for the user to input their question. The user can type any question they desire.  
**•	Response Generation:** Once the user enters their question, the program randomly selects one of the predefined responses from an array called "ResponsePool." The responses in the array simulate the Magic 8 Ball's mysterious and often whimsical answers.  
**•	Display Response:** The program then displays the chosen response to the user, creating an interactive and entertaining experience. This response is meant to provide an element of surprise and intrigue.  
**•	Continuation Prompt:** After displaying the response, the program prompts the user with a message, encouraging them to ask another question. This step ensures that the user can continue interacting with the Magic 8 Ball and receive more answers.  
**•	Input Validation:** If the user does not enter any question (i.e., submits an empty input), the program provides corrective feedback, reminding the user to ask a question. This validation ensures that the program maintains its interactive flow.  
**•	Exit Option:** The program allows the user to exit by providing a designated exit code or keyword (e.g., "exit" or "quit"). When the user enters this code, the program gracefully exits, bringing the Magic 8 Ball experience to a close.  

In summary, the Magic 8 Ball program in C offers an engaging and entertaining interaction with the user. It emulates the classic toy's responses, encourages continued questions, and provides a smooth exit mechanism for users who wish to conclude their experience. This program combines randomness and user engagement to recreate the playful spirit of the Magic 8 Ball in a digital form.
